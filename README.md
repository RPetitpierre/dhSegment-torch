**dhSegment** is a tool for Historical Document Processing. Its generic approach allows to segment regions and
extract content from different type of documents. 

This respository contains the PyTorch version of **dhSegment** which the one currently in development.

The no longer developed Tensorflow version can still be found at this [address](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io).

The original version was created by [Benoit Seguin](https://twitter.com/Seguin_Be) and Sofia Ares Oliveira at DHLAB, EPFL.

The complete rewrite in Pytorch was done by Sofia Ares Oliveira and Raphäel Barman. Current development is currently pursued by Raphaël Barman.

## Installation and usage

Documentation is in progress and will be available soon.
